As we reach the midpoint of 2024, it's a great time to reflect on what our lab has accomplished and share a preview of what's coming next.

## Papers and Publications

The first half of 2024 has been productive for our lab:

- **3 papers accepted** at top venues (NAACL, ACL, ICML)
- **2 preprints** posted to arXiv
- **1 journal article** published in TACL

Our work on adaptive fine-tuning has been particularly well-received, and we're excited to present it at EMNLP later this year.

## Software Releases

We've released v2.0 of our [NLP Toolkit](/projects/nlp-toolkit), which includes:

- Support for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods
- A new evaluation framework
- Improved documentation and tutorials

## New Team Members

We're happy to welcome two new members to the lab:

- A visiting researcher from Partner University working on multilingual NLP
- A summer intern from Undergraduate College exploring bias in language models

## What's Next

For the second half of 2024, we're focusing on:

1. Expanding our multilingual benchmark to cover more languages
2. Developing new methods for efficient inference
3. A new collaboration on AI-assisted scientific writing

Stay tuned for more updates!
