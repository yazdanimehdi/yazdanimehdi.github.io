Maria Garcia is a third-year PhD student in the Smith Research Lab. Her research explores safe and efficient reinforcement learning methods for robotic systems.

## Research Focus

Maria is currently working on:

- **Safe Exploration**: Developing RL algorithms that can learn efficiently while avoiding unsafe actions in physical environments.
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment of robotic policies.
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing robots that can naturally collaborate with human partners.

## Education

- **M.S. in Robotics**, University of Technology, 2022
- **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, State University, 2020
