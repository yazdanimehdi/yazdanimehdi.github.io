We are excited to announce that our lab has been awarded a $1.2M grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support our research on safety and alignment in artificial intelligence systems.

## Project Overview

The three-year project, titled **"Foundations of Safe and Aligned AI: From Theory to Practice"**, will investigate:

1. Formal verification methods for neural network safety properties
2. Scalable alignment techniques for large language models
3. Human-in-the-loop oversight mechanisms for autonomous systems

## Open Positions

This grant will fund two new PhD positions and one postdoctoral position. If you're interested in AI safety research, please check our [Join](/join) page for application details.
