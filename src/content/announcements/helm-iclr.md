Our paper, "HELM: Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling," has been accepted to ICLR 2025. Our work introduces a novel approach to understanding mRNA sequences by leveraging hierarchical language modeling, outperforming existing baselines by ~8% across six downstream property prediction tasks.
