Our paper, "Equi-mRNA: Protein Translation Equivariant Encoding for mRNA Language Models," has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
