We are thrilled to announce that our paper **"Adaptive Fine-Tuning Strategies for Large Language Models in Low-Resource Domains"** has been accepted at EMNLP 2024!

This work introduces a novel approach to efficiently adapt large language models to specialized domains with limited training data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several low-resource benchmarks while requiring significantly fewer compute resources than existing approaches.

Congratulations to all co-authors! We look forward to presenting this work in Miami.
